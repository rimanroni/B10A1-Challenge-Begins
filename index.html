            <h1>"In the near future, I hope to <br> become a Developer."</h1>
            <p>I am currently focused on enhancing my technical skills and knowledge to pursue a career as a software developer. With a passion for technology and problem-solving, I aim to contribute to the creation of efficient, scalable, and innovative software solutions. I have foundational experience in web development, specifically in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and TypeScript, and I am continuously improving my skills in front-end and back-end development.</p>
